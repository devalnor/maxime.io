          <h1>Keep It Stupid Simple</h1>
          Said Kelly Johnson aircraft engineer of the famous us aircraft SR-71
          Blackbird. Most solutions work best if they are kept simple rather
          than made complicated. Since then, all good software developper know
          for good reason the KISS acronym.

          <h1>Watch out the bullshits</h1>
          Nobody is perfect, so always be honest to acknowledge when you made
          bullshit. Is this principle already another bullshit ? Iâ€™ll let you
          judge by yourself ;-)
